# Creating a WPF spline area chart dashboard to visualize the details of the Women's 2024 T20 World Cup.

## Dashboard

Interpreting raw data can be a tedious and challenging task. However, visual representations such as charts and graphs make this process significantly easier and more intuitive. When these visual tools are enhanced with interactive features, understanding complex data becomes a piece of cake.

## Spline Area Chart

A [Spline Area Chart](https://www.syncfusion.com/wpf-controls/charts/wpf-spline-area-chart) is a variation of the area chart that uses smooth, curved lines to connect data points instead of straight lines. This chart type is particularly useful for visualizing data with a gradual trend, where smooth transitions between points can make the visualization more readable and aesthetically pleasing.

## Watermark

We can add any view to the plot area using [Watermark](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/wpf/Syncfusion.UI.Xaml.Charts.SfChart.html#Syncfusion_UI_Xaml_Charts_SfChart_Watermark) support, which is useful for adding any relevant data.
